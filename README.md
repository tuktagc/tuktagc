This is actually a kind of message for help, the cries of 19 yo teenager who want to live under the same conditions as you around the world.

I was accepted to best university of the region i'm in but this university is the best 1100-odd university of the world. 
My aim is MIT, Singapur National or Hong Kong National University. I dont know Chinese at the moment but I have to.
I would be very pleased if there is any company that wants to take me for intership in these regions.

I have two big problem where i live. Firstly, it's a forbidden to receive edducation here, and secondly, the technological tools that come here are taxes
by an average of %200 and then the prices tripled by 8 times due to exchange rate. It is very difficult for us to access a general request from you, can
you at least show me exactly where to look for the questions I ask, because when wee googled something here,the same results as yours do not come up.

thank you.
